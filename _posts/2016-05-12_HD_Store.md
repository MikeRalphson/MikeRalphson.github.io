Just a small update between iBL revisions 366 and 373. Details of store purchases now include a flag
to state if the version purchased was in HD or not.

The BBC Store website has a couple of FAQs on [HD content](https://help.store.bbc.com/s/article/What-are-SD-and-HD)
and [availability](https://help.store.bbc.com/s/article/Why-are-some-programmes-unavailable-in-HD).
