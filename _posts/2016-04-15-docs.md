The new draft [Nitro documentation](https://developer.bbc.co.uk/content/programmes-api) has been updated again, now including a FAQ section, and the entries
on building a title have been fleshed out. Still some todo items remain but hopefully this is another sign of progress towards Nitro Public. The Beeb are
welcome to copy the ImageChef recipe list from the [Open Nitro Wiki](https://github.com/Mermade/bbcparse/wiki/ImageChef-recipes).

Interestingly the list of feeds omits the `broadcast` feed entirely, again pointing towards its imminent deprecation.

The /programmes API, which is known to be on its last gasp of life, started returing `Invalid page number` errors for the `/episodes/player.json` endpoint.
Luckily I managed to find another endpoint, `/children` which contains similar data for the episodes/clips under a brand/series and is still working.

This fixed problems with [BBC Browser](mermade.github.io/bbc/category.html) and the [BBC-RSS adaptor](bbc-rss.herokuapp.com).
