This post is mainly about the iBL (iPlayer Business Layer) API changes.

We're now at version 1.0 release 366.

Between release 360 and 363 the BBC iBL team fixed a couple of issues I reported to them via email. A couple of typo's
in the JSON Schema meant the model definitions were not being referenced properly. There was also a missing model.
Many thanks to the iBL guys for fixing this.
